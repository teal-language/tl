# Teal documentation

You can read the latest published version of the documentation at
https://teal-language.org/book/.

## Building the documentation

The documentation for the website is generated using
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook). Install `mdbook` and then run
`mdbook build` in this directory: that should take the Markdown files from the
`src` directory and build the documentation in HTML format in the `book`
directory.
