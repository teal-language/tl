# The Grammar of Teal

Here is the complete syntax of Teal in extended BNF, based on the Lua 5.4
grammar. Lines starting with `+` are existing lines from the Lua grammar
with additions; lines marked with `*` are entirely new.

As usual in extended BNF, `{A}` means 0 or more `A`s, and `[A]` means an
optional `A`. For a description of the terminals Name, Numeral, and
LiteralString, see [Section 3.1 of the Lua 5.3 Reference
Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#3.1). For operator
precedence, see below.

## Operator precedence

Operator precedence in Teal follows the table below, from lower to higher priority:

```
     or
     and
     is
     <     >     <=    >=    ~=    ==
     |
     ~
     &
     <<    >>
     ..
     +     -
     *     /     //    %
     unary operators (not   #     -     ~)
     ^
     as
```

As usual, you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression.
The concatenation (`..`) and exponentiation (`^`) operators are right
associative. All other binary operators are left associative.
